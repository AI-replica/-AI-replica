# How to download a copy of everything Facebook knows about you

You can download your own archive of this data from Facebook. Here’s how:

    Go to Facebook.com/settings
    Tap “Download a copy of your Facebook data.”
    Tap “Download Archive.”
    It might take a few minutes, but Facebook will alert you when your archive is ready.
    When it is, click “Download Archive” again, and a zip file will download to your computer.
    Browse through that archive by opening each file inside the folder.

Again, what you’ll find is that this is an entire history of your life on Facebook.

# How can I make a copy of the content of the applications on my cell phone?

In this case we will not make a guide about it, because there can be as many guides as applications on the market.
Before installing such an application on your computer or mobile or tablet, do not hesitate to verify that the program can upload the records to the cloud. Either to a virtual hard disk on the Internet or to your email account with free storage space.

Remember to schedule an incremental backup to a high-capacity external hard drive with a rugged design.
Ideally have three drives for this purpose. This redundancy will prevent future disasters.

If you are a user of a medical or genetic analysis service, do not hesitate to transform all PDF documents into an interpretable text format. You can thus save your biological rhythms generated by your smartband or smartwatch, your genetic and biochemical analysis, etc.

Or psychological chatbot therapy or spaort tracking like a holter or heart-band.

Also the use of audio recordings from chat applications or voice-to-text transcription programs on phones and computers are a very powerful tool to record our conversations and personal monologues. 
Digital diaries with photo and text or direct transcription.
About personal monologues it is very important to do them in the privacy of home and alone in order to have the most accurate reflection of our private way of thinking, the free association linked to the individual personality.
It is also a good idea to use automatic transcription programs for video conferencing, for example meet from google, with browser extensions such as Tactiq. This way you can save not only video or voice, but also the transcript of the conversation.

All bureaucratic documentation can be saved in PDF format by cell phone, either by photo or by the free program ScanPDF on Android.
Psychological and psychiatric tests are also a great source of information or sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist.
After starting this compilation it is very important to classify and sort all the data by format and subject for further conceptual processing by the future artificial intelligence program.
