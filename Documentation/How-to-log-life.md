# _How to log life at the highest level._

# Summary.

This white paper is an essay on how to collect and optimize data extraction from a human down to the finest detail. And its possible utilities and uses. It is collaborative and evolutionary. The principles of formal and polite debate, the scientific method, and the principles of engineering and law are used.

The various information extraction methods for humans (and eventually pets) are compiled, explained, developed and updated.
for later computer reconstruction in a computer program that is as accurate and credible as possible.

Since it is not known if it will be successful, then this work falls into the field of research and development.

Since it is not possible to make reliable predictions, absolutely nothing is guaranteed at this point.

# How to download a copy of everything Facebook knows about you

You can download your own archive of this data from Facebook. Here’s how:

Go to Facebook.com/settings
Tap “Download a copy of your Facebook data.”
Tap “Download Archive.”
It might take a few minutes, but Facebook will alert you when your archive is ready.
When it is, click “Download Archive” again, and a zip file will download to your computer.
Browse through that archive by opening each file inside the folder.

Again, what you’ll find is that this is an entire history of your life on Facebook.

# How can I make a copy of the content of the applications on my cell phone?

In this case we will not make a guide about it, because there can be as many guides as applications on the market. Before installing such an application on your computer or mobile or tablet, do not hesitate to verify that the program can upload the records to the cloud. Either to a virtual hard disk on the Internet or to your email account with free storage space.

Remember to schedule an incremental backup to a high-capacity external hard drive with a rugged design. Ideally have three drives for this purpose. This redundancy will prevent future disasters.

If you are a user of a medical or genetic analysis service, do not hesitate to transform all PDF documents into an interpretable text format. You can thus save your biological rhythms generated by your smartband or smartwatch, your genetic and biochemical analysis, etc.

Or psychological chatbot therapy or sport tracking like a holter or heart-band.

Also the use of audio recordings from chat applications or voice-to-text transcription programs on phones and computers are a very powerful tool to record our conversations and personal monologues. Digital diaries with photo and text or direct transcription. About personal monologues it is very important to do them in the privacy of home and alone in order to have the most accurate reflection of our private way of thinking, the free association linked to the individual personality. It is also a good idea to use automatic transcription programs for video conferencing, for example meet from google, with browser extensions such as Tactiq. This way you can save not only video or voice, but also the transcript of the conversation.

All bureaucratic documentation can be saved in PDF format by cell phone, either by photo or by the free program ScanPDF on Android. Psychological and psychiatric tests are also a great source of information or sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist. After starting this compilation it is very important to classify and sort all the data by format and subject for further conceptual processing by the future artificial intelligence program.

# How to make a private life record.

Although the private registry of life has evolved a lot for both the public and private parts, a final phase can be added.

+ Our public behaviour is different from our private behaviour due to social conditioning. We should not only carry a camera or smart glasses that record all our vital and general data at all times and filter out irrelevant or repetitive information thanks to the latest advances in artificial intelligence and records of structured and unstructured information.

+ The solution to the private part refers to the life we ​​lead alone in our house or in private places, which is where our true person appears. There we have soliloquies, monologues or guttural conversations that express our private thoughts (it is curious that in experiments with myographs the movement of the human tongue has been recorded when thinking, with laryngophones the phonation when thinking, with written records and EEG the thinking; It turns out that all three are the same. And you don't even need a laryngophone, just a high-sensitivity tracking and directional microphone to pick up your 'inner voice.' And there are very cheap wireless tracking and tuning webcams with microphones for home.)

+ My idea is to set up a WiFi CCTV connected to the computer with presence and movement monitoring. And then apply image and signal processing to, through various algorithms, both classic and artificial intelligence, extract all possible information from the subject to process it and convert it into a complex multi-dimensional data set.

+ By itself it is not to save the videos constantly, it is to extract the essence of the individual. If one searches in depth on the Internet then one will find a multitude of tools and algorithms easily translatable to Python or the language of choice to create a meta-algorithm for feature extraction, analysis and data set generation on the smallest detail:

- facial, tonal, posture, gestural, sign language, micro-expressions, voice, inner voice, blinking, pupil dilation, body temperature, pulse, breathing, appearance, voice, stress, emotion, feeling, attention, health, safety, habits, aesthetics, way of dressing, tastes, fashion, conditioning, reasoning, dreams [record while you sleep and if you keep a dream diary then you can cross the information and infer a lot.] and use the other devices or programs or media logging to match data in a matrix and use other algorithms to deduce patterns, cause and effect, etc.
Including location [environmental behaviour determinism], climate, ecology, work, studies, classic vital registration, etc.

- Graph-logical and stylometry analysis can also extract information from the subject.

+ Also include complete psychological, psychiatric, medical, sports, genetic and biochemical analyses, genealogical and educational and bibliographic, film-graphic, musical, documentary, etc.

+ Transfer all this information to a digital format of high richness but low weight, order it, classify it, index it, and analyze it algorithmically, professionally and personally.

+ There is also one last tool: The 360º interview
It is a highly detailed interview made with friends, couples, lovers, family members, co-workers, social networks, professionals, etc.
To get as much information as possible, the most detailed, the most accurate, the ideal and the real and the unpleasant.

+ Then process it with tools for both structured and unstructured formats and then pass analysis tools, all possible.
Finally, a multi-dimensional and multi-format data set must be assembled to use a machine learning algorithm with an assembly of all the learning algorithms and create a continuous incremental model.

+ A good way to continuously and automatically generate a data set is to create a Python module that exploits the functions of Google's Techeable machine to create various types of models based on real-time data.

## Note from one of the authors: 
although initially it is oriented to a basic verbal model to follow an MVP philosophy to be realistic, the ideal is to use the complete model in detail within the Google GATO system, as it is the first type of AI system. general. And connected to a regulatory system based on the most comprehensive and general cognitive architecture that mimics the human brain based on long-standing, highly-reviewed research. Thus, the copy, which is still an artificial human agent that duplicates its original, can both function as a chat robot, as an avatar in virtual reality or eventually in a realistic robot or humanoid body in the real world.

## Note two of one of the authors:
Do not hesitate to study all the links, if you are a programmer, I recommend that you try to copy the representation, processing and analysis algorithms of all the historically registered tools. And assemble it into a construction that serves to explore the information space of the subject to be copied and as one tool and its logical generation of relationships in context are exhausted, then move on to the next. In this way we will be able to create a mechanism for observation, analysis, problem posing, resolution, demonstration, representation, classification, organization and automatic management of personal knowledge. And thus feed the model. Basically it's doing 'Human Mining' (I coined this term, 'Mental Mining' is also valid)
